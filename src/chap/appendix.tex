\chapter{Schottky spectrograms}
In this appendix can be found some Schottky spectrograms studied during the analysis.
\section{Injection identification in the NTCAP data}
Here we have an example of the injections identified by the V-method in the NTCAP data of the first high-resolution setting.
Figures related to the V-method

\section{Identified peaks and projections}
Here we can find the spectrograms with projections in time and frequency of the identified peaks in the sum of the first high-resolution set.

\section{Injection perturbation}
Here I will describe with more detail about the injection's frequency shift.
